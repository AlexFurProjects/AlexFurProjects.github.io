<h2>Perspective</h2>
Most pictures can be broken down into one, two, or three point perspective. The "points" refer to the vanishing point of a line segment. 

In one and two point perpective the vanishing points will usually fall on the horizon.
Vertical lines will be perpendicular to the horizon. 

In three point perspective you are viewing the scene from either really high up or really low.
Vertical lines will merge at the vanishing point not on the horizon.

Colors in perspective will tend to become more blue and more desaturated the further in the background they are.

For additional learning view the following:

Take the below images and find the vanishing points of the cubes and study the city scapes and attempt to recreate your own cityscape.
